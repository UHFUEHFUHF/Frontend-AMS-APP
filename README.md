#  AMS (Attendance Management System) ‚Äî Frontend

This is the frontend repo of my **Attendance Management System (AMS)** project. I'm building this to improve my skills in real-world full-stack development. The app is focused on helping institutes manage student attendance with modern tech like geolocation and face recognition.

##  Tech Stack

-  React.js (with Context API)
-  Tailwind CSS

1.  **Geolocation-based Attendance**  
   Use the Geolocation API to capture students' real-time locations while marking attendance.

2.  **Real-Time Attendance Updates**  
   Teachers and admins can see attendance being marked in real-time without refreshing.

3.  **Camera-Based Attendance**  
   Use the device's camera to capture photo proof when marking attendance.

4.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   Different dashboards and permissions for Admin, Teacher, and Student.

5.  **Face Recognition Integration** *(future scope)*  
   Facial recognition-based attendance using a webcam/camera.

6.  **Authentication & Authorization**  
   Secure login/signup system (JWT planned in backend).

7.  **Dashboard View**  
   Students and teachers can view attendance summaries with charts/tables.
